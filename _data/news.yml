    Our paper Learning Molecular Representation in a Cell has been accepted to ICLR 2025! 
    We introduce InfoAlign, a new approach for learning molecular representations from cellular response data, integrating features like cell morphology and gene expression. 
    By combining information bottleneck methods with context graphs, weâ€™re able to extract minimal yet sufficient representations of molecules that lead to better predictions and generalization in downstream tasks like molecular property prediction and zero-shot molecule-morphology matching.

    [Calibrated prediction of scarce adverse drug reaction labels with conditional neural processes](https://dmlr.ai/) 
    has been accepted in DMLR at ICLR 2024. This work introduces a meta-learning approach with neural processes to significantly enhance the accuracy 
    and calibration of adverse drug reaction (ADR) classification.
