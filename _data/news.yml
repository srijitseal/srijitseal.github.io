    [Calibrated prediction of scarce adverse drug reaction labels with conditional neural processes](https://dmlr.ai/) 
    has been accepted in DMLR at ICLR 2024. This work introduces a meta-learning approach with neural processes to significantly enhance the accuracy 
    and calibration of adverse drug reaction (ADR) classification.
